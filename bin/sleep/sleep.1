.Dt SLEEP 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm sleep
.Nd suspend execution for an interval of time
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Ar number Ns Op Ar unit
.Ar ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command suspends execution for a minimum of
.Ar number
seconds (the default, or unit
.Cm s ) ,
minutes (unit
.Cm m ) ,
hours (unit
.Cm h ) ,
or days (unit
.Cm d ) .
If multiple arguments are passed, the delay will be the sum of all values.
.Pp
The
.Nm
command supports other time units than seconds,
honors a non-integer number of time units to sleep in any form acceptable by
.Xr strtod 3 ,
and accepts more than one delay value.
These are non-portable extensions, but they have also been implemented
in GNU sh-utils since version 2.0a (released in 2002).
.Sh EXIT STATUS
.Ex -std
.Sh EXAMPLES
To schedule the execution of a command for 1800 seconds later:
.Pp
.Dl (sleep 1800; sh command_file >errors 2>&1)&
.Pp
This incantation would wait half an hour before
running the script
.Dq command_file .
(See the
.Xr at 1
utility.)
.Pp
To repeatedly run a command (using
.Xr csh 1 ) :
.Pp
.Bd -literal -offset indent -compact
while (1)
	if (! -r zzz.rawdata) then
		sleep 300
	else
		foreach i (*.rawdata)
			sleep 70
			awk -f collapse_data $i >> results
		end
		break
	endif
end
.Ed
.Pp
The scenario for a script such as this might be: a program currently
running is taking longer than expected to process a series of
files, and it would be nice to have
another program start processing the files created by the first
program as soon as it is finished (when zzz.rawdata is created).
The script checks every five minutes for the file zzz.rawdata.
When the file is found, processing the generated files (*.rawdata)
is done courteously by sleeping for 70 seconds in between each
awk job.
.Pp
To wait until a particular time, the following,
with some error checking added, might be used (using
.Xr sh 1
on
.Nx ) :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
END=$(( $( date -d "$1" +%s ) - START_TIME ))
while [ "${SECONDS}" -lt "${END}" ]
do
	sleep "$((END - SECONDS))"
done
.Ed
.Pp
where the argument
.Sq \&$1
specifies the desired date and time in any format the
.Fl d
option to the
.Xr date 1
command accepts.

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
command is expected to be
.St -p1003.2
compatible.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v4 .
The ability to sleep for extended periods appeared in
.Nx 9 .
.Sh BUGS
This
.Nm
command cannot handle requests for durations
much longer than about 250 billion years.
Any such attempt will result in an error,
and immediate termination.
It is suggested that when there is a need
for sleeps exceeding this period, the
.Nm
command be executed in a loop, with each
individual
.Nm
invocation limited to 200 billion years
approximately.
